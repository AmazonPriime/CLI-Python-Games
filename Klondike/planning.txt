##### Card Move Logic
--------------------------------------
## tableau -> tableau ('C4', 'C')
  * check arguments are valid
    - a
      ~ column letter must be A-G
      ~ index number must be less than the collection length
    - b
      ~ column letter must be A-G
  * check the card at the index number exists and is shown
  * if the column in arg b is empty
    - the card at index number must be a King
  * if the column in arg b is not empty
    - the last card in collection must be:
      ~ 1 rank higher and of different suit colour
  * if card can move
    - move the card over by merging the subset from index number
    - remove cards from the collection where cards are being moved
    - if the new last card there is not shown
      ~ change the card to be shown

## foundation -> tableau ('*1', 'C')
  * check arguments are valid
    - a
      ~ first char being * indicates foundation pile
      ~ index number must be 1-4
    - b
      ~ column letter must be A-G
  * check that foundation pile is not empty
  * if column in arg b is empty
    - King must be the top card of the foundation pile
  * if column in arg b is not empty
    - the last card in collection must be:
      ~ 1 rank higher and of different suit colour
  * if card can move
    - add the card to the collection
    - remove the card from the foundation pile

## waste -> tableau ('W', 'C')
  * check arguments are valid
    - a
      ~ arguments must be W
    - b
      ~ column letter must be A-G
  * check that the waste pile is not empty
  * if the collection at arg b is empty
    - King must be on top of the waste pile
  * if the collection at arg b is not empty
    - the last card in collection must be:
      ~ 1 rank higher and of different suit colour
  * if card can move
    - add the card to the collection
    - remove the card from the waste pile

## waste -> foundation ('W', '*')
  * check arguments are valid
    - a
      ~ argument must be W
    - b
      ~ argument must be *
  * check that the waste pile is not empty
  * if the foundation pile (same pile as the card's suit) is empty
    - card on top of waste pile must be an ace of that suit
  * if the foundation pile is not empty
    - card on top of waste pile must be 1 rank higher
    - and the same suit
  * if card can move
    - add the card to the foundation pile
    - remove the card from the waste pile

## tableau -> foundation ('C', '*')
  * check arguments are valid
    - a
      ~ argument must be A-G
    - b
      ~ argument must be *
  * check that the column from arg a is not empty
  * if the foundation pile is empty
    - card at bottom of collection must be an ace of same suit
  * if the foundation pile is not empty
    - card at bottom of collection must be
      ~ one rank higher and of the same suit
  * if card can move
    - add the card to the foundation pile
    - remove card from the collection
