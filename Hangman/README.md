# Python CLI Hangman

* Just a simple game of hangman developed in Python.
* Uses the command line to play, one person will type in the word they want others to guess and then the other players take turns typing in letters.
* When the word has been guessed (all the letters have been entered) the game will end and congratulate the players, then showing how many turns it had taken to get the word.

### How to play
